# lambda-utils

Utility functions that I bundle with my personal AWS Lambda Serverless stacks. 

util.py and util_datastores.py have no external dependencies. The other two have some. You can use my [Lambda Layers](https://github.com/alecbw/Generate-Lambda-Layers) to attach the needed libraries.

You'll notice these have quite a few TODOs. They are by no means finished.
