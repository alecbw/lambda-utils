# lambda-utils

Utility functions that I bundle with my personal AWS Lambda Serverless stacks. 

util.py and util_datastores.py have no external dependencies. The other three have one or more. You can use my [Lambda Layers](https://github.com/alecbw/Generate-Lambda-Layers) to attach the needed libraries.

This code is subject to breaking changes at any time. If you intend to use it, I recommend forking the repo.
